# WebhookDebug Component Tests

This directory contains test documentation for the WebhookDebug component and its sub-components. These are not executable tests but serve as documentation for the expected behavior of each component.

## Test Documentation Structure

Tests are documented by component:

- `WebhookRawData.test.tsx`: Documentation for the raw data display component
- `WebhookConfigAlert.test.tsx`: Documentation for the configuration alert component
- `WebhookFormattedData.test.tsx`: Documentation for the formatted data display component
- `WebhookDataSummary.test.tsx`: Documentation for the data summary component
- `WebhookTroubleshootingGuide.test.tsx`: Documentation for the troubleshooting guide component

## Mock Data

Mock data for testing is stored in `mockData.ts` and includes:

- `mockRawData`: Example of webhook data with various sections populated
- `mockEmptyData`: Example of webhook data with empty arrays
- `mockErrorData`: Example of an error response from the webhook

## How to Implement Actual Tests

To implement actual tests, you would need to:

1. Add testing libraries to your project:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest
   ```

2. Add TypeScript types for these libraries:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev @types/jest @types/testing-library__react
   ```

3. Configure Jest in your project by adding a jest.config.js file

4. Update the package.json to include test scripts

## Expected Test Coverage

These test documents describe how to verify:

1. Components render correctly with valid data
2. Components handle edge cases (null, undefined, empty data)
3. Interactive elements work as expected
4. Conditional rendering logic works correctly
